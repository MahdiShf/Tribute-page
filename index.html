        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Avicenna was born in around 980 in Afshana, a village near Bukhara in
          Transoxiana. His father, who may have been Ismaili, was a local
          Samanid governor. At an early age, his family moved to Bukhara where
          he studied Hanafi jurisprudence (fiqh) with Isma‘il Zahid (d. 1012)
          and medicine with a number of teachers. This training and the
          excellent library of the physicians at the Samanid court assisted
          Avicenna in his philosophical self-education. Thus, he claimed to have
          mastered all the sciences by the age of 18 and entered into the
          service of the Samanid court of Nuh ibn Mansur (r. 976-997) as a
          physician. After the death of his father, it seems that he was also
          given an administrative post. Around the turn of the millennium, he
          moved to Gurganj in Khwarazm, partly no doubt to the eclipse of
          Samanid rule after the Qarakhanids took Bukhara in 999. He then left
          again ‘through necessity’ in 1012 for Jurjan in Khurasan to the south
          in search no doubt for a patron. There he first met his disciple and
          scribe Juzjani. After a year, he entered Buyid service as a physician,
          first with Majd al-Dawla in Rayy and then in 1015 in Hamadan where he
          became vizier of Shams al-Dawla. After the death of the later in 1021,
          he once again sought a patron and became the vizier of the Kakuyid
          ‘Ala’ al-Dawla for whom he wrote an important Persian summa of
          philosophy, the Danishnama-yi ‘Ala’i (The Book of Knowledge for ‘Ala’
          al-Dawla). Based in Isfahan, he was widely recognized as a philosopher
          and physician and often accompanied his patron on campaign. It was
          during one of these to Hamadan in 1037 that he died of colic.
